This is the default theme for [papaya CMS](https://github.com/papayaCMS/). 

It is responsive and accessible. However, it only covers the basic modules (e.g. page). If you need support for further modules (e.g. forum, newsletter and many, many more), you might want to have a look at it's "predecessor" [papayacms-theme-default](https://github.com/papayaCMS/papayacms-theme-default).
